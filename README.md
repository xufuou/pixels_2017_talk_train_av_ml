**Running the scripts and notebook**

I recommend the usage of [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/userguide/) before installing the dependencies.(Optional)

To run the notebook and the scripts install the required dependencies with pip.

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Classifying a file
